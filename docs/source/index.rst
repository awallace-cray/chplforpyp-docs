Chapel for Python Programmers
=============================

Subtitle: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Curlybracket.

So, what is Chapel and why should u care? We all know that Python is the best thing since sliced bread it comes with batteries included and there is nothing that can't be expressed with Python in a short, concise, elegant, and easily readable manner.

But, if you find yourself using any of these packages: Bohrium, Cython, distarray, mpi4py, multithreading, multiprocessing, NumPy, Numba, and/or NumExpr. You might feel that Python's batteries need a recharge.

.. You might then think that you would need to delve into the world of curlybrackets, implementing low-level methods in C/C++ and binding them to Python. There is an alternative, it does have curlybrackets, but you won't get cut on the corners.

Consider then Chapel, it comes with a set of turbo-charged batteries, batteries for parallelism!
If parallelism, communication, and performance is a concern for you, and you enjoy a nice clean syntax, then you might start caring about Chapel.

Do read on.
