If Chapel had a band
====================

One of their songs might be a cover of "Hot Chocolate - Every 1's a Winner"::

    "Every 1's An Iterator"

    Never could believe the things you do to me
    Never could believe the way you are
    Every day I bless the day that you got through to me
    'Cause baby, I believe that you're a star

    Everyone's an iterator, that's the truth (yes, the truth)
    Making loops with you is such a thrill
    Everyone's an iterator, that's no lie (yes, no lie)
    You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)
    Let's do it again

    [Instrumental]

    Never could explain just what was happening to me
    Just one touch of you and I'm a flame
    Baby, it's amazing just how wonderful it is
    That the things we like to do are just the same

    Everyone's an iterator, that's the truth (yes, the truth)
    Making loops with you is such a thrill
    Everyone's an iterator, that's no lie (yes, no lie)
    You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)

    [Instrumental]

    Let's do it again

    Everyone's an iterator, that's the truth (yes, the truth)
    Making loops with you is such a thrill
    Everyone's an iterator, that's no lie (yes, no lie)
    You never fail to satisfy (satisfy)

    Oh, baby
    Oh, baby
    Oh, baby...

TODO: Example of implementing the above as an iterator...
