Chapel and Python Examples
==========================

The code snippets throughout the documentation are kept here. Test should be
written for all snippets. For Chapel tests, add .good files (and any other
files) and `start_test` (from Chapel project) will run them. For Python tests,
add to the test case in `test_all_python.py`. `py.test` will then run the
tests.
